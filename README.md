## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes `npm`) installed on your system.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git](https://github.com/your-username/expense-tracker.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the client directory:**
    ```sh
    cd expense-tracker/client
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Create an environment file:**

    Create a file named `.env` in the `client` directory. This file will hold your API keys. (Based on our `api.js` and `auth.js` files, you'll need these):

    ```env
    # URL for your authentication backend (Login, Register)
    VITE_AUTH_API_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/auth

    # URL for your expenses backend
    VITE_EXPENSE_API_URL=http://localhost:4001/api/expenses

    # URL for your lend/borrow backend
    VITE_LENDBORROW_API_URL=http://localhost:4002/api/lendborrow
    ```
    *(**Note:** Adjust the port numbers (`4000`, `4001`, `4002`) to match your actual backend server setup.)*

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

* `npm run dev` - Starts the development server.
* `npm run build` - Builds the app for production.
